Imagine\nimport random as rnd\n\nst = \"\"\"When everyone you have ever loved is finally gone\nWhen everything you have ever wanted is finally done with\nWhen all of your nightmares are for a time obscured as by a shining brainless beacon\nOr a blinding eclipse of the many terrible shapes of this world\nWhen you are calm and joyful and finally entirely alone\nThen in a great new darkness you will finally execute your special plan\nOne needs to have a plan someone said who was turned away into the shadows\nAnd who I had believed was sleeping or dead\nImagine he said all the flesh that is eaten\nThe teeth tearing into it the tongue tasting its savour and the hunger for that taste\nNow take away that flesh he said\nTake away the teeth and the tongue the taste and the hunger\nTake away everything as it is\nThat was my plan my own special plan for this world\nI listened to these words and yet I did not wonder\nIf this creature whom I had thought sleeping or dead would ever approach his vision\nEven in his deepest dreams or his most lasting death\nBecause I had heard of such plans such visions and I knew they did not see far enough\nBut what was demanded in a way of a plan\nNeeded to go beyond tongue and teeth and hunger and flesh\nBeyond the bones and the very dust of bones and the wind that would come to blow the dust away\nAnd so I began to envision a darkness that was long before the dark of night\nAnd a strangely shining light that owed nothing to the light of day\nThat day may seem like other days\nOnce more we feel the tinylegged trepidations once more we are mangled by a great grinding fear\nBut that day will have no others after no more worlds like this will follow\nBecause I have a plan a very special plan\nNo more worlds like this no more days like that\nThere are but four ways to die a sardonic spirit might have said to me\nThere is dying that occurs relatively suddenly\nThere is dying that occurs relatively gradually\nThere is dying that occurs relatively painlessly\nThere is the death that is full of pain\nThus by various means they are combined\nThe sudden and the gradual the painless and the painful\nTo yield but four ways to die and there are no others\nEven after the voice stopped speaking I listened for it to speak again\nAfter hours and day and years had passed I listened for some further words\nYet all I heard were the faintest echoes reminding me there are no others\nWas it then that I began to conceive for this world a special plan\nThere are no means for escaping this world it penetrates even into your sleep\nAnd is its substance you are caught in your own dreaming\nWhere there is no space and are held forever where there is no time\nYou can do nothing you are not told to do\nThere is no hope for escape from this dream that was never yours\nThe very words you speak are only its very words\nAnd you talk like a traitor under its incessant torture\nThere are many who have designs upon this world and dream of wild and vast reformations\nI have heard them talking in their sleep of elegant mutations and cunning annihilations\nI have heard them whispering in the corners of crooked houses\nAnd in the alleys and narrow back streets of this crooked creaking universe\nWhich they with their new designs would make straight and sound\nBut each of these new and illconceived designs is deranged in its heart\nFor they see this world as if it were alone and original\nAnd not as only one of countless others whose nightmares all proceed\nLike a hideous garden grown from a single seed\nI have heard these dreamers talking in their sleep\nAnd I stand waiting for them as at the top of a darkened flight of stairs\nThey know nothing of me and none of the secrets of my special plan\nWhile I know every crooked creaking step of theirs\nIt was the voice of someone who was waiting in the shadows\nWho was looking at the moon and waiting for me to turn the corner and enter a narrow street\nAnd stand with him in the dull glaze of moonlight\nThen he said to me he whispered that my plan was misconceived\nThat my special plan for this world was a terrible mistake\nBecause he said there is nothing to do and there is no where to go\nThere is nothing to be and there is no one to know\nYour plan is a mistake he repeated\nThis world is a mistake I replied\nThe children always followed him when they saw him hopping by\nA funny walk a funny man a funny funny funny man\nHe made them laugh sometimes\nHe made them laugh oh yes he did he did he did he did he did\nOh how he made them roll\nOne day he took them to a place he knew a special place\nAnd told them things about this world this funny funny funny world\nwhich made them laugh sometimes\nThen the funny little man who made them laugh sometimes he did\nRevealed to them his special plan his very special funny plan\nKnowing they would understand and maybe laugh sometimes\nHe made them laugh oh yes he did he did he did he did he did\nTheir eyes grew wide beneath their lids\nAnd how he made them roll\nI first learned the facts from a lunatic\nIn a dark and quiet room that smelled of stale time and space\nThere are no people nothing at all like that\nThe human phenomenon is but the sum of densely coiled layers of illusion\nEach of which winds itself upon the supreme insanity\nThat there are persons of any kind when all there can be is mindless mirrors\nLaughing and screaming as they parade about in an endless dream\nBut when I asked the lunatic what it was that saw itself within these mirrors\nAs they marched endlessly in stale time and space\nHe only rocked and smiled then he laughed and screamed\nAnd in his black and empty eyes I saw for a moment as in a mirror\nA formless shade of divinity in flight from its stale infinity\nOf time and space and the worst of all of this worlds dreams\nMy special plan for the laughter and the screams\nWe went to see some little show that was staged in an old shed past the edge of town\nAnd in its beginnings all seemed well\nThe miniature curtain stage glowed in the darkness\nWhile those dolls bounced along on their strings before our eyes\nAnd in its beginnings all seemed well but then there came a subtle turning point\nWhich some had noticed and I was one who quietly left the show no I did not\nBecause I could see where things were going\nAs the antics of those dolls grew strange\nAnd the fragile strings grew taut with the tiny pullings of tiny limbs\nThe others around me became appalled and turned away and abandoned the show\nThat was staged in an old shed past the edge of town\nBut I wanted to witness what could never be I wanted to see what could not be seen\nBut the moment of consummate disaster when puppets turn to face the puppet master\nIt was twilight and I stood in the greyish haze of a vast empty building\nWhen the silence was enriched by a reverberant voice\nAll the things of this world it said\nAre of but one essence for which there are no words\nThis is the greater part which has no beginning or end\nAnd the one essence of this world for which there can be no words\nIs but all the things of this world\nThis is the lesser part which had a beginning and shall have an end\nAnd for which words were conceived solely to speak of\nThe tiny broken beings of this world it said\nThe beginnings and endings of this world it said\nFor which words were conceived solely to speak of\nNow remove these words and what remains it asks me\nAs I stood in the twilight of that vast empty building\nBut I did not answer\nThe question echoed over and over but I remained silent until the echoes died\nAnd as twilight passed into evening I felt my special plan\nFor which there are no words\nmoving towards a greater darkness\nThere are some who have no voices or none that will ever speak\nBecause of the things they know about this world\nAnd the things they feel about this world\nBecause the thoughts that fill a brain that is a damaged brain\nBecause the pain that fills a body that is a damaged body\nExist in other worlds countless other worlds\nEach of which stands alone in an infinite empty blackness\nFor which no words have been conceived and where no voices are able to speak\nWhen a brain is filled only with damaged thoughts when a damaged body is filled only with pain\nAnd stands alone in a world surrounded by infinite empty blackness\nAnd exists in a world for which there is no special plan\"\"\"\n\n#-----Experimental stuff:\n#bilinear = False #not working\n#experimental_resample = False #not working\n# only if no
